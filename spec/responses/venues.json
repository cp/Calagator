W Burnside St.","description":"Nestled underneath the floating-floored Crystal Ballroom & Lola's Room in downtown Portland, Ringlers Pub is housed in what was once an automotive service garage. How much more convivial it is now! Named for the Crystal's originator -- dance aficionado and entrepreneur Montrose Ringler -- Ringlers features a tall, wooden-beamed ceiling and massive, tiled bar. The crack of pool cues make a merry soundtrack in the cavernous interior. Before or after a concert upstairs, treat yourself to ales from the Crystal's brewery along with some hearty pub fare. Or check out one of Ringlers regular DJ'd events ... there's never a cover!","country":"US","telephone":"(503) 225-0627","longitude":"-122.684797","email":"","id":202390475,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"McMenamins Ringlers Pub","region":"Oregon","address":"1332 W Burnside St."},{"updated_at":"2011-03-06T00:22:06-08:00","wifi":true,"url":"","locality":"Troutdale","latitude":"45.536738","events_count":2,"source_id":996333151,"postal_code":"97060","created_at":"2008-08-02T19:31:52-07:00","access_notes":"","street_address":"2126 Sw Halsey St","description":"","country":"US","telephone":"","longitude":"-122.406787","email":"","id":202390487,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"McMenamins Edgefield","region":"Oregon","address":""},{"updated_at":"2008-08-02T19:32:01-07:00","wifi":false,"url":null,"locality":"Portland","latitude":"45.532089","events_count":1,"source_id":996333152,"postal_code":"97210","created_at":"2008-08-02T19:32:01-07:00","access_notes":null,"street_address":"SW Park Place","description":null,"country":"US","telephone":null,"longitude":"-122.729353","email":null,"id":202390488,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"Washington Park","region":"Oregon","address":null},{"updated_at":"2011-03-06T00:12:08-08:00","wifi":true,"url":"","locality":"Portland","latitude":"45.515067","events_count":7,"source_id":996333155,"postal_code":"97204","created_at":"2008-08-02T19:33:44-07:00","access_notes":"","street_address":"1221 SW 4th Avenue","description":"","country":"US","telephone":"","longitude":"-122.678453","email":"","id":202390492,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"City Hall","region":"Oregon","address":""},{"updated_at":"2008-08-08T13:01:14-07:00","wifi":false,"url":"http://www.artinstitutes.edu/portland/","locality":"Portland","latitude":"45.524024","events_count":17,"source_id":996333157,"postal_code":"97209","created_at":"2008-08-03T10:54:22-07:00","access_notes":null,"street_address":"1122 NW Davis","description":"","country":"US","telephone":"503-228-6528","longitude":"-122.682665","email":"","id":202390494,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"Art Institute of Portland","region":"Oregon","address":""},{"updated_at":"2008-08-05T10:53:44-07:00","wifi":false,"url":"http://www.oliveortwistmartinibar.com","locality":"Portland","latitude":"45.529477","events_count":1,"source_id":996333158,"postal_code":"97209","created_at":"2008-08-05T09:19:07-07:00","access_notes":null,"street_address":"925 NW 11th Ave","description":"Martini bar","country":"US","telephone":"(503)546-2900 ","longitude":"-122.682362","email":"","id":202390498,"closed":false,"duplicate_of_id":null,"title":"Olive or Twist","region":"Oregon","address":""},{"updated_at":"2009-04-20T12:34:15-07:00","wifi":false,"url":"http://www.portland.jbfsale.com/","locality":"Portland","latitude":"45.606485","events_count":2,"source_id":996333162,"postal_code":"97217","created_at":"2008-08-06T11:32:30-07:00","access_notes":null,"street_address":"2060 North Marine Drive","description":"Just Between Friends is the nation's leading Children's and Maternity Consignment Sale!
