Patel studied at MIT's media lab and mediated discussions of Internet futures at Gigaom. Now he is CEO of an Internet of Things startup.

Slept with your laptop? Or become so overwhelmed that you just unplugged from it all? In this funny, eye-opening, and inspiring film, Director Tiffany Shlain takes audiences on an exhilarating rollercoaster ride to discover what it means to be connected in the 21st century. From founding The Webby Awards to being a passionate advocate for The National Day of Unplugging, Shlain’s love/hate relationship with technology serves as the springboard for a thrilling exploration of modern life…and our interconnected future. Equal parts documentary and memoir, the film unfolds during a year in which technology and science literally become a matter of life and death for the director. As Shlain’s father battles brain cancer and she confronts a high-risk pregnancy, her very understanding of connection is challenged. Using a brilliant mix of animation, archival footage, and home movies, Shlain reveals the surprising ties that link us not only to the people we love but also to the world at large. A personal film with universal relevance, Connected explores how, after centuries of declaring our independence, it may be time for us to declare our interdependence instead.","start_time":"2013-08-28T19:00:00-07:00","id":1250464721,"venue_details":"Pre-register @http://www.prsa-portland.org/ai1ec_event/special-presentation-of-connected-an-autoblogography-about-love-death-technology/?instance_id=343\r\n","rrule":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"venue":{"updated_at":"2013-08-13T22:07:38-07:00","events_count":1,"latitude":"45.5222409","locality":"Portland","url":"http://www.prsa-portland.org/ai1ec_event/special-presentation-of-connected-an-autoblogography-about-love-death-technology/?instance_id=343","wifi":false,"postal_code":"97205","source_id":null,"access_notes":"","created_at":"2013-08-13T22:06:36-07:00","country":"US","description":"","street_address":"341 SW 10th Ave","email":"","longitude":"-122.6816019","telephone":"","closed":false,"id":202393983,"duplicate_of_id":null,"address":"341 SW 10th Ave PORTLAND OREGON","region":"OR","title":"Living Room Theaters,"},"venue_id":202393983,"version":null,"title":"PRSA/SEMpdx Present “Connected”  Film Screening"},{"updated_at":"2013-08-22T15:10:25-07:00","end_time":"2013-08-28T20:30:00-07:00","url":"http://i.imgur.com/aWphN8d.jpg","source_id":null,"created_at":"2013-08-22T15:10:25-07:00","description":"We will head to the Skidmore Bluffs, and then eat food and enjoy a beautiful summer sunset.\n\nBring your own food, and drink if you want.\n\nBiking is probably easiest.

Yet demonstrating this has been a vexing challenge for designers. Using metrics that matter to leaders as the kernel in a story is key to meeting business leaders halfway in their quest to understand what design, UX and HCI can do for them. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, there is not a clear-cut set of metrics, a “clip of silver bullets”, that works for all situations. What to measure then, is highly situational. Design Thinking is perfect for developing solutions to highly situational challenges. \n\nThis presentation will cover the presenter’s examples and experiences in successfully applying Design Thinking to demonstrate the value of design, UX and HCI to business in: \n•Determining what to measure for a situation \n•Measuring what matters to key stakeholders\n•Designing a viable, sustained measurement system\n•Communicating the results with impact to key stakeholders\n\nAbout the Speaker\nSteve Sato is the founder of Sato+Partners, a management consulting and organization development firm by and for design leaders. Steve works with executives, directors and their teams to build experience, design and innovation capability through using existing work to bootstrap. Previously, Steve was at Hewlett-Packard and led its customer-centered strategy and planning consultancy, then later in Corporate Design, led building experience design capability across the company. Steve was formerly at Doblin Group as a design planner and also at Accenture, pioneering customer-centered design for the company in their advanced R&D group.\n\nHe has a Masters in Design from the Institute of Design at IIT, Masters of Engineering Management from Northwestern University and a Bachelor’s of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois.

It takes serious effort to find application for those capabilities and hiding the good stuff among the familiar just makes doing new things harder.\n\nIn this presentation I'll describe my own lurch forward over the last two years.

However, for companies incorporating crowdsourcing into existing business practices, specific issues must be addressed: What problem are we trying to solve? How do we control the process? How do we incentivize people to achieve our goals? Ultimately, the key to successfully employing a crowdsourcing model is to move beyond the realm of the \"mob\" to create an engaged, interactive community of diverse and skilled professionals. In the world of quality assurance, crowdsourcing has the potential to effectively solve emerging challenges and take your testing to new heights. Using real-world examples, uTest's John Montgomery explains how you can leverage the crowd to complement your internal systems, ensure systems work as intended under real-world conditions and effectively manage the scalability of efforts.
